Tell me about a website yo visted using the Wayback Machine. What year is it from?
How is the older version different from the current version today in terms of its overall design?

The website I visited was NBC and it is from 2013.
The older version is different fromt the current version by the amount of tabs you can click on, therefore it really isn't easy to follow. The older version is also more cluttered than the current version.
