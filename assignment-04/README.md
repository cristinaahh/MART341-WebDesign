Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.

The browsers I use to surf the internet is Google Chrome and Safari. These browsers function by a rendering engine, in which can read, image, video, svg, audio files and can also read html and xml documents. Browsers don't all use the same rendering engine so this is why things differ when you use different browsers. When you open up a webpage, the rendering engine reads the html then constructs the website by using the DOM (document object model) Content Tree. This process happens really fast which is why you don't the nodes forming. After this process happens you are able to interact with the website.
