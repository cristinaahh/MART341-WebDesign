What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

Padding is space around elements in a border, margin is the white space around the outside of the border, and a border can be transparent or have color to it and it is the something that is around a box or any shape.

Also the thing I was struggling this week and last week is trying to make my big image smaller and center it. I couldn't figure it out.
