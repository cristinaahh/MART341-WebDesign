In your README.md file, please describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

Forms that I have come across while browsing the web is honestly all of them. But the most common one I see is either the drop down menus or for tests radio buttons are very common. Forms serve many purposes. It makes your website more interactive and help people get to where they want to go on your website.
